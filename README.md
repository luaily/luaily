## hello!
i'm luaily, a below average american high school art student, graphic designer, game and software developer and animator.  
i excel in procrastination, im serious, if you need something done, give me a deadline set the week before you need it done and don't tell me, or else it won't get done on time.

### technical pronunciation key: `/loʊ-ˈæli/`
use something like [IPA reader](https://ipa-reader.com/) to hear the above key pronounced. 

depending on your accent    
Most will understand from: `lo-allie`,  
or alternatively: `"LOH AL-ee"`,  
or if you still can't say it 
 * say `"low"` like in the word *"below"*,
 * then say `"alley"` like in the word *"alleyway"*,
 * now put it together and retry `"low alley"`

im going to be honest sometimes i can't even say my own nickname lol.

### here's what i'm working on:
1. **LinkMC** - *a minecraft and discord account verification platform.*
2. **SHuDR** - *a self hostable security focused replacement for Discord, taking the best of Discord, Teamspeak, and Slack and making it self-hostable. name subject to change, "**S**elf **H**ostable **u**sable **D**iscord **R**eplacement"*
3. SoundByte or "**.mikuPlayer**" - *a self-hostable & decentralized music player so you and your friends can share your legally obtained MP3s or, with full streaming and lossless support.*
4. **Mountain** - *a minecraft java pvp client for version 1.8, with minor 1.16 and 1.20 support.*

### full skillset

**graphic designer**: i work in adobe photoshop, illustrator, and have some experience in motion graphics through adobe after effects

**game developer**: i used to make flash player games back in the day, though i moved to making bad roblox games after. all my flash player games are dead.

**software developer**: i work on replacement software mainly now, i like self-hostable things because i get to control my own data.


**animator**: i have some motion graphics experience, though i like working on storyboards and sometimes animate in opentoonz (because adobe animate sucks).
